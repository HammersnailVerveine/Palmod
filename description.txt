This mod adds a summoner subclass allowing the player to tame NPCs and use them like minions.
It is NOT balanced, and will likely never be, but profides a fun and unique experience.

There WILL be bugs in the early versions of the mod, please tell me if you encounter any!
Multiplayer is currently not implemented, but will be in the future.
