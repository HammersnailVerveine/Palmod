This mod adds a summoner subclass allowing the player to tame NPCs and use them like minions.
Even though I'm doing my best, the nature of the mod means it is NOT balanced, and will likely never be, but provides a fun and unique experience :)

The first capture sphere is sold by the Merchant, and can be upgraded.

There WILL be bugs in the early versions of the mod, please tell me if you encounter any!
Multiplayer is currently not implemented, but will be in the future.

The mod will be compatible with Modded NPCs using vanilla AIStyles.
Please, do not ask if the mod is compatible with X or Y, mod, I do not know, try it out

Thanks to @Chevalier for the Chinese Localization of the mod!
